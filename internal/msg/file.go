// File is a typed message for file content in the conversation — a file_read
// tool result, or a briefing preload. It keeps the identity a wire message
// erases — which path, which line range, what content, which tool call it
// answers — so the loop can reason about file content as content: deduplicate
// a re-read of the same range, and evict by re-derivability when the context
// tightens (file content is the one thing that can always be fetched again).
//
// Deliberately NO wire form is stored: the identity is content + pairing, and
// the wire SHAPE (tool_result vs user text) is Lower()'s rendering decision —
// the precondition for ever A/B-ing per-provider forms (docs/message-model.md
// 关键设计 4). Today the decision is fixed: paired content renders as the
// tool_result it answers, unpaired as user text.
//
// A File is held by pointer so it can be stubbed IN PLACE: stubbing swaps the
// lowered text for a one-line pointer while keeping the message's position and
// tool_call pairing — the 1:1 lowering invariant and the wire protocol's
// call/result pairing both stay intact.
