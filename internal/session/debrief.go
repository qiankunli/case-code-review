// Debrief is a unit's terminal record — one line per review Unit written when
// its loop ends. Briefing goes in, debrief comes out: it captures what the run
// knew at that moment and what post-hoc analysis cannot reconstruct (outcome
// vs policy skip, unit formation, briefing degradations), plus a per-unit cost
// rollup so eval never re-aggregates raw llm_response records.
//
// Field groups mirror the metric dashboards (eval/README.md): outcome →
// robustness, formed → granularity, clues/materials/usage → context, the
// aggregated tail → cost.
