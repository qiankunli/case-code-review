// The split pipeline names two kinds of Unit:
//
//   - a DIFF UNIT is what a Splitter finds in one file's diff — one per changed
//     function, plus a residual for changes outside any function.
//   - a REVIEW UNIT is what a Merger consolidates the diff units into — the unit
//     that actually triggers a review loop. A review unit is a diff unit as-is, or
//     several diff units coalesced up the granularity ladder (function → class →
//     file → module/directory) when a change is large.
//
// Two stages, two abstractions: Splitter (diff → diff units) and Merger (diff
// units → review units).

// FileFragments pairs one file's Fragments with their source diff. It is the
// input to a Merger, which needs the file diff to build a coalesced file Unit.
type FileFragments struct {
	Diff      model.Diff

// Merger consolidates per-file Fragments into review Units, coarsening up the
// granularity ladder by a strategy when there are too many — trading
// per-function focus for fewer review loops.

	Merge(files []FileFragments) []Unit

// WatermarkMerger keeps diff units as review units until their total exceeds
// Watermark, then coalesces each file that split into more than one unit into a
// single file review unit. This is the function → file rung of the ladder; class
// and module/directory rungs are future strategies. Coalescing preserves spec
// context (CoalesceFile unions the members' function ids), so the governor caps
// loop count, not context.
