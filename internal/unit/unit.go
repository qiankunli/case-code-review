// Package unit models the two stages of the review pipeline:
//
//   - Fragment — the atom: one file's changed region (a function's hunks, or the
//     file residual). A Splitter's output. Pure data: no context, no grouping.
//   - Unit — the review scope: 1..N Fragments grouped by an axis (one function;
//     same-file coalesced; or a cross-file call chain) plus the context (Clues)
//     gathered for that scope. A Merger's output; the review loop runs once per
//     Unit.
//
// (diff → Fragment → merge → Unit → review loop. See docs/unit-model.md.)
